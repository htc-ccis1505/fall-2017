## Introduction
In this lab we will experiment with drawing different types of polygons, look for a pattern to use for generalization, and then write a *generic* function to draw a polygon with any number of sides.  In this lab we will learn how to use a repeat loop to repeat code a set number of times.  We will also learn to write functions, or create new custom blocks in Snap!, which allows us to add new commands to a programming language.

## Assignment

There is one *challeng* problem in this lab to __Draw a star__. It's meant to get you thinking, and isn't supposed to come easy. Spend some time thinking about it, but don't hesitate to ask for help if you get stuck.
