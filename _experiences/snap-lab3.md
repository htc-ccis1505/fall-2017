## Introduction
In this lab we will discuss variables, and examine how to create and use them in our Snap! programs. We will also learn to work logical operators and with program structures that use them to make decisions about whether or not parts of the code should run.

## Assignment
[Lab 3: Variables and Conditions](https://htc-ccis1505.github.io/main-labs/topic/topic.html?topic=htc_fund/intro_pair/3-conditionals-v2.topic&course=htc_f17.html)

%}

When answering the in-lab multiple choice questions, try to do it __WITHOUT__ building and running the code.  Try to *think* through what the computer will do, then see if you are correct or not.  You'll learn a lot more by doing this, and not just running the code.

This lab also contains more problems where you must come up with a solution on your own instead of just following the steps in the lab.  Don't skip these parts of the lab, just because you aren't turning in the code!  These allow you to practice the skills you will need to do later assignments and exam problems in an open environment where you are free to discuss and share solutions with your classmates.

If you are not able to complete all of the problems in class, continue working on them at home so that you have working solutions to all of the problems.
