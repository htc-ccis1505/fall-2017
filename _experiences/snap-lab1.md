## Introduction
For our first lab assignment, we will learn to work with Snap! a graphical block based programming language. By using blocks, we will avoid many of the typing errors that students struggle with when using text based languages. We'll build up some confidence working in Snap! while learning basic logic and programming structures. Later in the course we will move into working with python once we are more confident in our abilities.

We will also be working in pairs for this lab, so find a lab partner and buddy up.  Don't forget to switch roles throughout the lab between driver and navigator.

The last part of the lab with the __Kaleidoscope__ is a little tough. Spend some time thinking about it, but don't worry if you don't get it finished in class.
