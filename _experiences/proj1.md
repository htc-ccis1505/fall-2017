title: Project 1 - Word Guessing Game
summary: "The first project is a word guessing game."
---

# {{ page.title }}
Our first project is a word guessing game.  One player will enter in a *secret word* and then the other player will try to guess it.  After each guess, the program will tell the player how many letters in their guess line-up with the letters in the *secret word*.  The player will continue guessing until they guess the word correctly and win the game.  

This code is very similar to the number guessing game that we worked on in the earlier lab. However instead of guessing with numbers, we are using a word or *string*.  That means that you will also need to understand the material on strings and loops presented in this week's lab to complete the work.


## Assignment
The assignment details are found in the following PDF:

### Tips
When working on the project, focus on breaking the problem down into smaller steps that you can create blocks (or functions) to address. This will allow you to solve and test small pieces of the program separately and independently before trying to put it into the larger program.  Also, use script variables over global variables, using function input parameters and output (report) values to communicate between the blocks (functions) and your main program script.

Save your code often and back it up in more than one spot. Losing your work should never be an
excuse. Use OneDrive, the D2L Dropbox (you can submit multiple times), or email it to yourself.

Test! In a perfect world, users would read all of the user documentation provided and interact with a
program exactly as the designer intended. But few people actually read documentation. We
have to design good programs to prevent user mistakes or mitigate them. Most importantly, we have to
make sure user error does not break our code. Remember to handle the situation when the user
guesses​ ​a​ ​word​ ​that​ ​is​ ​too​ ​long​ ​or​ ​too​ ​short.

### Submission
The project includes two parts:
1. The actual project code.
2. A ReadMe file that explains the game and discusses what you have learned.

The ReadMe file is 30/100 points, so without completion of the ReadMe file, the highest grade you will get is a 70% or C.  __Please do not forget to submit the ReadMe file.__
