## Introduction
This introduces strings and the various Snap! blocks used when working with them.  The lab also introduces two new loops, the `for` and `repeat until` loops. Both are very important loops that are used frequently in programming problems.

## Assignment
[Lab 4: Strings & More Loops](https://htc-ccis1505.github.io/main-labs/topic/topic.html?topic=htc_fund/intro_pair/3.5-for-strings.topic&course=htc_f17.html)

This lab also contains many problems where you must make a block and come up with a solution on your own instead of just following the steps in the lab.  Remember, don't skip these parts of the lab!  These allow you to practice the skills you will need to do later assignments and exam problems in an open environment where you are free to discuss and share solutions with your classmates.

If you are not able to complete all of the problems in class, continue working on them at home so that you have working solutions to all of the problems.
