## Assignment
The HW lab is intended to build on and further develop the skills you learned in the in-class lab.

[Lab 2 - HW: Loops and Functions](https://htc-ccis1505.github.io/main-labs/topic/topic.html?topic=htc_fund/intro/2-loops-blocks-hw.topic&course=htc_f17.html)

For these assignments, you want to focus on creating and using functions:  

- The __Field of Flowers__ program is focused on using composition to create a complex block by using simpler block to perform parts of the larger task.  
- The __Bug Dance__ is a little more focused on the decomposition side, asking you to break down a bug dance into functions or blocks to do some dance moves. This is a little more open to creative interpretation. It doesn't say exactly what you must do; it only requires that you build functions that use input parameters to choreograph (or compose) your dance.

When you have completed the assignments you will need to export each of the Snap! programs to submit to the Assignment box on D2L. If you have forgotten how to export your code, you can refer back to [Lab 1: An Introduction to Snap!](https://htc-ccis1505.github.io/main-labs/cur-new/programming/snap-intro/save-and-share.html?topic=htc_fund%2Fintro%2F1-introduction-short.topic&course=htc_f17.html).
