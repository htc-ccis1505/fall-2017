## Lab Introduction
This week's lab focuses on the blocks for working with strings.  A __string__ is just a sequence of characters, like a word or a sentence.  However strings can contain any character, not just letters. For example a sentence might also contain punctuation and/or numbers: "The zip code for downtown St. Paul is 55101."

Computers represent all of their data in binary, 1's and 0's. That means that the characters in strings of text are also represented as numbers. At the end of the lab, we will briefly look at __unicode__ which is a way of representing nearly all of the characters in written language throughout the entire world numerically (or as numbers). This idea of unicode is something to be aware of, but isn't a large focus for the programming we will do in this course.

## Course Progress
We are about 1/3 of the way through the course, bringing us to our first project and exam.  Next week in class we will have our first exam, which will cover all of the material we have learned so far, including the material in this lab.  The first project will also be due the week following the exam.

### Exam 1
Remember that you can have a sheet of notes for the exam.  I encourage you to go back over the work you have done in lab and the lecture content and make notes on things to remember. The key concepts from lecture including generalization, abstraction, composition and decomposition will be covered on the exam along with programming concepts (functions, variables, etc.) and problems.

There will be no make-up exams given for any reason.

The course has an exam "stomp" policy which means that you can replace any earlier exam score with a later exam score.  That means that if you do poorly on the first exam, you can replace it with a higher score from either the second exam or the final exam.  You want to do your best on this first exam, but if things do not go well (or you cannot attend class for the exam) this policy makes it very easy to still well in the course by replacing the score later on.

The best way to study for the exam is completing the HW Lab 4, which is designed as an exam review, and by reviewing the work done in earlier labs. It is also recommended that you start work on Project 1 as it also reviews concepts covered on the exam.

### Project 1
Our first project is a word guessing game.  One player will enter in a *secret word* and then the other player will try to guess it.  After each guess, the program will tell the player how many letters in their guess line-up with the letters in the *secret word*.  The player will continue guessing until they guess the word correctly and win the game.  

The project is very similar to the number guessing game from HW Lab 3. However instead of guessing with numbers, we are using a word or *string*.  That means that you will also need to understand the material on strings and loops presented in this week's lab to complete the work.

Remember to break down the problem into smaller pieces.  You want to make blocks (or functions) to solve and test small pieces of the program separately. Then use those blocks to build the larger program.  Also, use script variables over global variables, using function input parameters and output (report) values to communicate between the blocks (functions) and your main program script.

The project includes two parts:
1. The actual project code.
2. A ReadMe file that explains the game and discusses what you have learned.

The ReadMe file is 30/100 points, so without completion of the ReadMe file, the highest grade you will get is a 70% or C.  __Please do not forget to submit the ReadMe file.__
