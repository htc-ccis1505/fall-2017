In this course, we will be using a technique called pair programming. Pair programming is the practice of writing code, in pairs instead of individually. Two people work at one computer to solve a problem together. Much like you would have a lab partner in a science class, you will have also have a pair programming partner for this class.

## How to Pair
When writing code as a pair, one person acts as the __driver__ actively controlling the computer, while the other person acts as the __navigator__ watching, planning and directing. While the driver types the code for the program, the observer helps plan and catch errors.

An important feature of pair programming is that the partners switch roles frequently. This ensures that each partner has a good understanding of all parts of the program, and that the person in each role remains focused. It's a good practice to switch roles at the end of a larger task or after a group of smaller tasks.

Pair programming takes active effort from both members of the team, and it can take some time and practice to get used to it. It will probably feel a little awkward at first, but remember that your pair probably feels the same way. A pair is more likely to work together if they talk not just about the code, but the experience of working together. Speak up if your pair does something that you don't like or makes you uncomfortable, and encourage them if they are doing something helpful.

### Do's & Don'ts

DO:

- Introduce yourself and make sure you know the name of your pair.
- Communicate. You should be constantly communicating with your partner throughout lab.
- Pay attention to your partner.
  - If you're the driver, don't focus only on the code & neglect your partner.  
  - If you're the navigator, actively follow the code offering suggestions and asking questions.
- Swap roles frequently throughout the lab.  
- Don't rush.  Be patient, and take time to make sure you are both comfortable with the code.
- Respect each other. Everyone has something to contribute.
- Take breaks.
- Be prepared.  Don't expect your partner to carry you through the lab.
- Consider personal space & personal hygiene.
- Celebrate your wins! Have fun!

DON'T:

- Work side-by-side on separate computers & separate solutions.
- Take the keyboard or mouse from the driver.
- Check your phone, email, etc.
- Continue working while your partner isn't in the room.
- Be bossy. Offer suggestions, but it is important to solve the problems together.
- Be intimidated. Speak up if you have questions, a different idea, or see a problem.
- Suffer in silence. If you have problems with your partner talk with your instructor.

    content="If your partner is not contributing to lab, do your best to be patient, encouraging, and understanding. Make sure you are offering them the opportunity to contribute. However, if the problem continues or if they are clearly unprepared or behind, let the instructor (or student instructor) know so that assistance can be provided and repeat problems with this do not go unrecognized. This can be done discretely in class, or later through email."

## Why Pair?
While pair programming can take a some getting used to, most students are glad to have done it at the end of class. There are many reasons that pair programming is a recommended practice. Some benefits include:

- You're more likely to stay focused.
- Fewer mistakes are made when you've got someone watching your back.
- It saves time, as you have someone to talk through problems with when you're stuck.
- Builds confidence with discussing code, logic, and programming concepts
- Helps you to write cleaner, clearer and more maintainable code.
- Being comfortable giving and receiving feedback, is a very important *life* skill.
- Getting to know your classmates, means you're not in this alone!

### Better Educational Outcomes
Pair Programming is a practice that has been heavily adopted in education. Many colleges and universities promote pair-programming, and it is also a common practice in coding bootcamps. The reason behind this is that it helps new programmers learn to code.

Many studies have shown that using pair-programming supports better outcomes in introductory programming courses. That means that when pair programming is used in class, students are:
 - more likely to complete the class; they don't drop
 - more students pass the class; they don't get an F
 - students overall have higher scores

As a student, that sounds good, right?

### Job Skills
This isn't just about learning.  We're also developing important job skills as we work in pairs. There are hidden benefits to this practice that are important to recognize.

>Employers on our advisory committee often say that they would take a candidate with weaker technically and excellent communication and people skills over a candidate who is stronger technically but has weaker soft skills.

#### Communication
There are few jobs in *any* industry where communication skills are not important. As you are discussing the lab and working with your pair, you are practicing your communication skills. As you talk about the code you are writing, you learn to explain it in a way that someone else can understand. You also get feedback from your lab partner on how well you are explaining your work as they ask questions or confirm your understanding.

#### Team Work
Team work - working with others to solve a problem - is also a vital job skill. Today, almost all work is done collaboratively as a team, and team work involves many of the same skills you'll use while working as a pair. After all a pair is a team of two.

Key team skills include:

- clearly communicating ideas & concepts
- using the correct technical terms
- being able to give and receive feedback
- speaking up with confidence, getting your ideas heard
- asking clarifying questions to develop an idea or solution
- identifying potential problems & offering suggestions for improvement

Employers on our advisory committee often say that they would take a candidate with weaker technically and excellent communication and people skills over a candidate who is stronger technically but has weaker soft skills.  Why?  They believe it is easier to train & strengthen the technical skills on the job.


### Professionals Pair Program
Pair programming itself is a job skill. Many IT professionals use pair-programming as a regular part of their job. While this is practiced differently in various organizations and teams, it has grown in popularity in recent years alongside the adoption of Agile Development.  Pair Programming is a recommended [Agile Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) practice.

## Collaboration and Academic Honesty
An important consideration when working as a pair or a team is giving appropriate credit for work. If the work is not done individually, this should be clearly indicated when submitting the assignment. Make sure that everyone's names are included on the submitted assignment.

Labs are required to be completed as a pair, or as a small group of 3 when we have an odd number of students. However each person needs to keep a copy of the code and submit it (when required) to the assignment drop box to be graded. When submitting the assignment code, add a comment to indicate the name(s) of all contributors. If this is not done, points may be deducted for lack of team work & lab participation.

Other assignments will indicate that they are to be completed individually. When this is true, no two assignments should look exactly the same or even be significantly similar. For individual assignments, it is OK to __*discuss*__ the work with other students, but it is __*not OK*__ to just add or copy their code or parts of their code into your assignment.

> For individual assignments, it is OK to __*discuss*__ the work with other students, but it is __*not OK*__ to just add or copy their code or parts of their code into your assignment.

Please make sure that you read and understand the academic honesty policy laid out in the course syllabus. If you have any questions on how this policy applies to your assignments, be sure to ask. Ignorance is not an excuse, and students who do not comply with the academic honesty policy will not receive credit for the work and may be reported to the college administration.
