## What is programming?
Programming is a way to get a computer to do what you want it to do.

There are many programming languages that you can use to communicate with the computer. In this class we will begin working with a visual language called [*Snap!*](http://snap.berkeley.edu/) that runs in your web browser. Later we will begin working with [Python](https://www.python.org/), which is a text based programming language that is widely used in education and professionally.

## Why learn to program?
Computers are everywhere.  Being able to work with - to use - a computer is clearly important, but just using what others have made is limiting. If you are able to make the computer do what you want it to - program it - the possibilities are infinite.

### Employment
For students pursuing a career in IT (Information Technology), being able to program can lead to higher paying jobs. Clearly if you want to be a Developer or Software Engineer, programming is vital to your job. But it's becoming more and more ubiquitous throughout IT. Networking is not just about running wires and configuring routers, programming is an increasingly important skill to support automation, virtualization, and [Software Defined Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking].

> Whether you just want to get away from basic help desk support work, or move up to a better Networking, Security, or Testing role, programming skills can be the stepping stone you need to improve your career.

### Problem Solving
Problem solving is a life skill. It is important to many jobs. While it is especially important within IT (Information Technology) careers, it's also important in many other fields including sales and customer service, construction, and medicine. It's even important in your personal life, for example dealing with a leaky sink or broken down car.

### Thinking Logically
Computers do *exactly* what you tell them. They don't know what you *mean*, they do exactly what you say. You need to be logical and precise in your instructions to them. You can imagine a computer as a precocious 3-year old that when you say "Pick up your toys" leaves the crayons all over the floor because they are not toys.

> When you're programming, you're teaching possibly the stupidest thing in the entire universe, a computer, how to do something. ~ Gabe Newell

This need to be exact and precise in your code can lead to much frustration while programming, and is the source of many bugs. However, learning to say what you mean in code can also help you say what you mean to the rest of the world too. Clear communication is an important life skill that is also valued by many employers.

## Learning Advice
Learning programming is much like learning to play a musical instrument, play a sport, or learn a language. We're training ourselves to learn a set of tools that can be used and improvised upon to solve a variety of problems. Learning a language, sport or instrument requires mastering a few basic rules and patterns, generally through repetition. Once you understand the basics, you uses those basic rules and patterns in different ways to create more complex outcomes. As you gain an understanding of how the basics can be adapted and changed through practice, you are on your way to becoming a master.

However the thing that many fail to recognize is that the road to mastery is not a smooth one. We never get better without making mistakes, and sometimes these mistakes lead to failures. It's important to realize that one will never master anything without overcoming failure along the way. Sometimes we forget to keep this in mind and when we hit failure after failure, it becomes very easy to quit or give up - to stop trying.

> I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over, and over, and over again in my life, and that is why I succeed. ~ Michael Jordan

It's natural for us to compare ourselves to others, and it's easy to focus on those who seem to be succeeding when we are not. It is easy to think they were born with a special talent, that they are somehow different from us, and that because of that we can't be like them. However this really is untrue. No one has found a music gene, a golf gene, a basketball gene, or a linguistic gene. There is also no computer programming gene. What really distinguishes those who succeed from those who fail is often no more than persistence.
