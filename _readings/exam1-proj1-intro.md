### Exam 1
Remember that you can have a sheet of notes for the exam.  I encourage you to go back over the work you have done in lab and the lecture content and make notes on things to remember. The key concepts from lecture including generalization, abstraction, composition and decomposition will be covered on the exam along with programming concepts (functions, variables, etc.) and problems.

There will be no make-up exams given for any reason.

The course has an exam "stomp" policy which means that you can replace any earlier exam score with a later exam score.  That means that if you do poorly on the first exam, you can replace it with a higher score from either the second exam or the final exam.  You want to do your best on this first exam, but if things do not go well (or you cannot attend class for the exam) this policy makes it very easy to still well in the course by replacing the score later on.

The best way to study for the exam is completing the HW Lab 4, which is designed as an exam review, and by reviewing the work done in earlier labs. It is also recommended that you start work on Project 1 as it also reviews concepts covered on the exam.

### Project 1
Our first project is a word guessing game.  One player will enter in a *secret word* and then the other player will try to guess it.  After each guess, the program will tell the player how many letters in their guess line-up with the letters in the *secret word*.  The player will continue guessing until they guess the word correctly and win the game.  

This code is very similar to the number guessing game that we worked on in the earlier lab. However instead of guessing with numbers, we are using a word or *string*.  That means that you will also need to understand the material on strings and loops presented in this week's lab to complete the work.
